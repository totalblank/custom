Info -> Adding one to an integer variable increases its
	value by one, but adding one to a pointer variable
	increases its value by the number of bytes of the
	type to which it points. Adding one to a pointer
	to double adds 8 to the numberic value on systems
	with 8-byte double, whereas adding one to a
	pointer-to-short adds two to the pointer value if
	short is 2 bytes.
