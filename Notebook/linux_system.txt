A linux system has THREE main levels.

1. The hardware is at the base.
   Hardware includes memory as well as
   one or more Central Processing Units
   (GPUs) to perform computation and 
   to read from and write to memory.
   Devices such as disks and Network
   Interfaces are also part of the 
   hardware.

2. The next level up is the kernel,
   which is the core of the OS. The
   kernel is software residing in
   memory that tells the CPU what to
   do. The kernel manages the hardware
   and acts primarily as an interface
   between the hardware and any running
   running program.

3. Processes - the running programs
   that the kernel manages - collectively
   make up the system's upper level,
   called user space.

N.B. -> The kernel runs in kernel mode,
	and the user processes run in
	user mode.
