Absolute Line Numbers

Using the number option, Vim sets up absolute line
numbers to show the line number for each line in the
file I am working on.

" turn absolute line numebers on
:set number
:set nn

" turn absolute line numebers on
:set nonumber
:set nonu

" toggle absolute line numbers
:set number!
:set nu!


Relative Line Numbers

With the relativenumber option, each line line in my
file is numbered relative to the cursor's current
position to show the distance to that line. The current
line is marked 0, the ones above and below are marked 1,
and so on.

" turn relative line numbers on
:set relativenumber
:set rnu

" turn relative line numbers off
:set norelativenumber
:set nornu

" toggle relative line numbers
:set relativenumber!
:set rnu!


"Hybrid" Line Numbers

Since Vim 7.4, enabling number and relativenumber at the
same time produces hybrid line number mode. All lines will
show their relative number, except for current line, which
will show its absolute line number.

" turn hybrid line numbers on
:set number relativenumber
:set nu rnu

" turn hybrid line numbers off
:set nonumber norelativenumber
:set nonu nornu

" turn hybrid line numbers on
:set number! relativenumber!
:set nu! rnu!
