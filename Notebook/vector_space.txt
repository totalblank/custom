Definition -> A vector space is a set V along with an addition
	on V and a scalar multiplication on V such that following
	properties hold:

	commutativity
	u + v = v + u for all u,v in V;

	associativity
	(u + v) + w = u + (v + w) and (ab)v = a(bv) for
	all u,v,w in V and all a,b in F;

	additive identity
	there exists an element 0 in V such that
	v + 0 = v for all v in V;

	additive inverse
	for every v in V, there exists w in V such that
	v + w = 0;

	multiplicative identity
	1*v = v for all v in V;

	distributive properties
	a*(u + v) = a*u + a*v and (a + b)*v = a*v + b*v 
	a,b in F and all u,v in V.

Info -> Elements of a vector space are called vectors or points.

Info -> The scalar multiplication in a vector space depends on F.
	Thus when we need to be precise, we will say that V is a
	vector space over F instead of saying simply that V is a
	vector space. For example, R^n is a vector space over R,
	and C^n is a vector space over C.

Info -> A vector space over R is called a real vector space.

Info -> A vector space over C is called a complex vector space.

Info -> The elements of the vector space R^[0,1] are real valued
	functions on [0,1], not lists. In general, a vector space
	is an abstract entity whose elements might be lists,
	functions, or weird objects.
