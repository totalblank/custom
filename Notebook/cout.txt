Info -> cout must translate a number in integer form
	into character form before it can print it.
	Furthermore, cout is smart enough to recognize that
	carrots (an int variable) is an integer that requires
	conversion.

Info -> If you give cout the address of a character, it prints
	everything from that character to the first null
	character that follows it. If the address given to cout
	is the address of a character which is at the middle
	of a string (i.e. the address pointing to 'b' in
	"srabon"), then cout will print everything character
	starting from and including that character to the end
	of the string.

Info -> cout << "Hello World!";

	To be consistent with cout's hadling of string output,
	this quoted string should also be an address. And it is,
	for in C++ a quoted string, like an array name, serves
	as the address of its first element. The code above
	doesn't really send a whole string to cout; it just sends
	the string address. This means strings in an array, quoted
	string constants, and strings described by pointers are
	all handled quivalently. Each is really passed along as
	an address. That's certainly less work than passing each
	and every character in a string.
