Info -> There can be multiple source files (i.e. .c or .cpp)
	and multiple header files (.h).

	To complile the code we need to run the following
	command

		g++ -o <executable> <source1> <source2> ...
		gcc -o <executable> <source1> <source2> ...

Info -> Usually, we declare prototypes of functions
	in .h files and define their working algorithm
	in .cpp files.
