Info -> While using 'source' command causes the commands
	in the script to be run as if they were part of 
	login session, the "just the name" method causes the
	shell to do a series of things. First, it runs another
	copy of the shell as a subprocess; this is called a
	sub-shell. The sub-shell then takes commands from the
	script, runs them, and terminates, handing control back
	to the parent shell.
