Info -> The new operator returns the address of
	the first element of the block.

	int *psome = new int [10]; // get a block of 10 ints
	delete [] psome; // free a dynamic array

Info -> The presence of the brackets tells the program
	that it should free the whole array; not just
	the element pointed by the pointer. Absence of
	the brackets tells otherwise.

Info -> In short, you should observe these rules when
	you use new and delete:

	* Don't use delete to free memory that new didn't
	  allocate.

	* Don't use delete to free the same block of memory
	  twice in succession.

	* Use delete [] if you used new [] to allocate an
	  array.

	* Use delete (no brackets) if you used new to allocate
	  a single entity.

	* It's safe to apply delete to the null pointer
	  (nothing happens).
