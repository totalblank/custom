Info -> The new operator returns the address of
	the first element of the block.

	int *psome = new int [10]; // get a block of 10 ints
	delete [] psome; // free a dynamic array

Info -> The presence of the brackets tells the program
	that it should free the whole array; not just
	the element pointed by the pointer. Absence of
	the brackets tells otherwise.
