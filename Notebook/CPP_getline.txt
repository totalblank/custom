Info -> 
	cin.getline(charr, 20);
	
	The dot notation indicates that the getline()
	function is a class method for the istream class.
	The first argument indicates the destination
	array, and the second argument is the array size,
	which getline() used to avoid overrunning the array.

	getline(cin, str);

	There is no dot notation, which indicates that this
	getline() is not a class method. So it takes cin as
	an argument that tells it where to find the input.
	Also, there isn't an argument for the size of the
	string because the string object automatically resizes
	to fit the string.
