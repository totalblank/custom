Info -> setf is a method from ostream class.
	
	cout.setf(std::ios_base::fixed, std::ios_base:floatfield);

	This particular call forces output to stay
	in fixed-point notation so that you can better
	see the precision. It prevents the program from
	switching to E notation for large values and
	causes the program to display six digits to
	the right of the decimal. The arguments
	are constants provided by including iostream.
