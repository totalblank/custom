Info -> A union is a special data type available in C/C++
	that allows to store different data types in the
	same memory location. You can define a union with
	many memebers, but only one member can contain a
	value at any given time. Unions provide an efficient
	way of using the same memory location for multiple
	purpose.

Info -> One and only one member can persist a defined value
	by the user at any given time. And the size of the union is the size
	of its largest memeber.
