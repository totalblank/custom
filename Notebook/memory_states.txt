Info -> A state is a particular arrangement
	of bits.

e.g. -> If I have four bits in my memory
	0001, 0101, represents two different
	states.
N.B. -> One of the kernel's tasks is to 
	split memory into many subdivisions,
	and it must maintain certain state
	information about those subdivisions
	at all times. Each process gets its
	own share of memory, and the kernel
	must ensure that each proces keeps to
	its share.
