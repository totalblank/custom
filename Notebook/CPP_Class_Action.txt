Info -> The class description specifies all the
	operations that can be performed on objects
	of that class. To perform such an allowed
	action on a particular object, you send a
	message to the object. For example, if you
	want the cout object to display a string, you
	send it a message that says, in effect, "Object!
	Display this!" C++ provides a couple of ways to
	send messages. One way, using a class method, is
	essentially a function call. The other way, which
	is the one used with cin and cout, is to redefine
	an operator. Thus the statement

	cout << "I am not a crook."

	uses the redefined << operator to send the
	"display message" to cout. In this case, the message
	comes with an argument, which is the string to be
	displayed.
