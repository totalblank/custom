Definition: The Russel's barber paradox is an example
of self-referential statement that refers to iteself
in a negative way. The paradox considers a barber in 
a small town that shaves all men in the town, but
only those men, who do not shave themselves. The
prophetic question then arises, does the barber
shave himself? If you say the barber shaves himself,
then the barber does not shave himself since he only
shaves those who do not shave themselves. On the other
hand, if you say the barber does not shave himself,
then he shaves himself since he shaves those who 
do not shave themselves. This paradox was formulated
by the English logician Bertrand Russel in 1901.
